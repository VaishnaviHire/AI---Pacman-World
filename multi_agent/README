q1) Evaluation function depends upon following factors:
    - new position of ghost and the pacman
    - position of food in current food grid
    - Timer value of ghosts

    1.If the new position of ghost and pacman is same it is given a score of -inf
    2.If the timer for ghost is non zero, then pacman needs to go near it, hence value of 2.0 is added to the score
    3.Pacman needs to go in the direction of nearest food in current grid, hence a value of 1/ min(distance of food in food-grid from pacman position) is added to the score.
    


q5) A better evaluation function depends upon:

    - position of the food Capsule
    - score of the pacman at current game state
    - number of scared ghosts
    - position of ghost and the pacman
    - position of food in current food grid
    - Timer value of ghosts

    1.If the new position of ghost and pacman is same it is given a score of -inf
    2.If the timer for ghost is non zero, then pacman needs to go near it, hence value of 2.0 is added to the score
    3.Pacman needs to go in the direction of nearest food in current grid, hence a value of 1/ min(distance of food in food-grid from pacman  position) is added to the score.
    4.The pacman needs to go as far from ghosts as possible, hence a value of -5.0 * (1/ min( distance between pacman and ghost) is added to final score.
    5.The pacman needs to go in the direction of capsule, hence a value of 1/min(distance between capsule and pacman) is added to the score
    6.More the number of scared ghosts more the chances of pacman to score, hence the number of scared ghosts is added to final score
    7.Finally, the score of the current game state is also added to evaluation function.
